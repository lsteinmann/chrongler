Description: This package provides convenience functions that are helpful
    for working with archaeological or historical data were chronological
    information is stored as a 'period' (categorical values that may
    indicate chronology in one way or another). The functions are purely
    for formatting and 'wrangling' such data, and do not contain any means
    of analysis or further processing.
