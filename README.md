# chrongler
This package provides convenience functions that are helpful for working with archaeological or historical data were chronological information is stored as a 'period' (categorical values that may indicate chronology in one way or another). The functions are purely for formatting and 'wrangling' such data, and do not contain any means of analysis or further processing. The scope is very limited and many results could be accomplished a lot easier using functions from the [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse). 

# why
I made it mainly for myself to avoid redundancies in various other projects and have the process a bit more organized. You may notice that it is very much tailored to data imported from [Field Desktop](https://github.com/dainst/idai-field) via [idaifieldR](https://github.com/lsteinmann/idaifieldR).
